## Prerequisites

- Make sure you're using PyCharm Community or Professional.

- Make sure you've already installed Python. Python is already installed on your computer if you're running macOS or Linux. Python can be downloaded from python.org.

- Let's develop a Python script to get started with PyCharm.

# Creating a Python project

---

1. Click New Project if you're on the Welcome screen. 

```{r   out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap='' }
knitr::include_graphics("fig/1_welcomescreen.png")
```

---

Choose File -> New Project from the main menu if you already have a project open.

```{r   out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap='' }
knitr::include_graphics("fig/2_newproject.png")
```


---

Although PyCharm may be used to create a variety of projects, we'll use it to create a simple Pure Python project in this tutorial. This template will start with an empty project.

```{r   out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap='' }
knitr::include_graphics("fig/3_screen.png")
```


- Choose a location for the project. Select the directory for your project by clicking the Browse button next to the Location field.

- Give a name for the project

---

-  According to Python best practices, each project should have its own virtualenv.

- PyCharm creates a fresh virtual environment for you most of the time, and you don't have to do anything. You can still see and change the venv options. Select a tool to construct a new virtual environment by expanding the **Python Interpreter: New Virtualenv Environment node**. Select the Virtualenv tool and enter the environment's location as well as the base Python interpreter for the new virtual environment.

```{r   out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap='' }
knitr::include_graphics("fig/4_interpreter.png")
```
---

- The path to the Python executable must be specified when establishing the base interpreter. PyCharm offers two alternatives if it detects no Python on your machine: download the latest Python versions from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or specify a path to the Python executable (in case of non-standard installation).

- Refer to [Configure a Python interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html#add-existing-interpreter) for more details.

- Now click the Create button at the bottom of the New Project dialog.

- If you already have a project open, PyCharm will ask if you want to create a new project in the current window or in a new one once you click Create. Choose Open in current window to close the current project, although you can return to it later.

# Opening a project


---

<!--
For further information, see the pages [Open, reopen, and close projects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/open-projects.html).

-->

- On the Welcome Screen, click the Open link.

- From the main menu, select File --> Open.

```{r   out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap='' }
knitr::include_graphics("fig/5_open.png")
```

# Reopening recent projects
- PyCharm keeps a history list of recent projects from which you can choose the one you want.

- When PyCharm starts, the most recent project reopens by default (unless this option is disabled on the System Settings page of the Settings/Preferences dialog.

 # Closing projects
 
If you need to close only one project, you can either close the project window or select File --> Close Project from the main menu.

## Remove a project from the list of recent projects


---

- Click the closing icon for the project to remove.

- The selected project will be removed from the list of the recent project in the **Project window** and on the **Welcome screen**.


```{r   out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap='' }
knitr::include_graphics("fig/6_closing.png")
```


---

- To remove a project only from the list on the Welcome Screen, right-click the target project and select Remove Selected from Welcome Screen.

```{r   out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap='' }
knitr::include_graphics("fig/7_closing.png")
```
